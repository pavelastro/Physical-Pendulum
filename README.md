# Physical-Pendulum
This is a physical pendulum 
The random optimum problem of the FPS-isolated rigid structure, under Gaussian white noise ground motions, is studied. It is an innovative sliding isolation system consisting of an articulated slider on a comcave spherical surface. it has been used to study non-linear and random vibration performances of the pendulum. 
PS:  The calculations have been studied under Gaussian white noise ground motions

Based on the analytical solutions of the joint probability density function of the steady-state responses and
the sliding reliability function of the system, the random optimum mathematical model of the system is configured by
selecting the root-mean-square of the horizontal absolute acceleration of FPS slider as the objective function and the
optimization design parameters are calculated
